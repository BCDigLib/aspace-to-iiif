# Using the API
If you're just getting started, read the [Working with the ArchivesSpace API](https://github.com/BCDigLib/bc-aspace/wiki/Working-with-the-ArchivesSpace-API) 
wiki page. It walks through the basics of the API, including authentication.

We tend to prefer Python and Ruby for data wrangling, but you can use any 
language with an HTTP library to work with the ArchivesSpace API. We'll try to 
add examples in other languages if relevant use cases come up. In the meantime, 
feel free to use the examples in this repo as a starting point.
